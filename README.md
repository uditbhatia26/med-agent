# Drug Repurposing Decision Intelligence Platform

This project provides an AI-powered decision intelligence solution that helps pharmaceutical and biotech teams evaluate new therapeutic uses for existing drugs. It brings together scientific, clinical, commercial, and regulatory signals into a single, explainable view so teams can quickly assess feasibility, risks, and next steps.

By automating the collection and synthesis of evidence, the platform reduces early-stage uncertainty, supports transparent decision-making, and accelerates identification of viable repurposing opportunities.
